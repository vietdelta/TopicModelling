"Anh Minh,Thuy Duong",Thuy Duong,2019-11-13 00:19:38,"Super excited and happy for my dear friends Duc Antoine Nguyen & Thuy Duong for all their success! Such hard working and determined entrepreneurs! Check out their cute Baubles & Soles shoes here. Don’t forget grab a pair or two for you and your little ones! 15% Coupon code is available. Enter Sharktank at checkout! Happy sole shopping!  https://www.facebook.com/132370630129731/posts/2877894342243999?d=n&sfns=moI wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their support. I honestly needed a day to recover but now I’m back, with a grateful heart and even more determination for the next step forward. I wanted to share with you guys an excerpt from my journal - it’s private and I never thought it would be shared (hence the bad handwriting!) but I couldn’t help but be astounded by how events have unfolded.  On 9th November 2018, I decided to write down a goal - that we would appear on Shark Tank. And every day for one year, I worked quietly towards that goal. At the time I set that goal - Shark Tank was an illusive dream. Remembering that every year, 40,000-60,000 companies audition to be on the show, with about 150 companies picked for the pitch and only 80-100 companies aired. Our Shark Tank episode aired on 10th November 2019, exactly one year and one day after I had set that intention and goal. If you have seen the episode, you will know it was an emotional one and we put up a fight until the very end.  What I’m trying to say with this long-winding post is this - if you have a dream, write it down. Then take steps every single day towards achieving that dream. And it will be yours. There’s been a lot of support from the mainstream community about my fighting spirit (we even made it on CNBC!) I think that’s just a part of being Vietnamese. And the truth is? A lot of the orders that have come in have been from our Vietnamese audience. So with this in mind, I want to ask everyone to do 2 things: 1. share this post with someone who needs proof that dreams can come true. 2. If you need shoes or need to find a gift for someone, head over to our website: www.baublesandsoles.com Use the discount code: TOILANGUOIVIETNAM to take 20% off your order.  This is the largest discount we have ever publicly shared. And it’s my way of saying thank you. Thùy Dương cảm ơn cả nhà rất là nhiều! ￼ With all my heart + sole, Lisa Thuy Duong",248,224,1,22,1,,,5 bình luậ,2894312620579801,/story.php?story_fbid=2894312620579801&id=112167142127710,Lưu
